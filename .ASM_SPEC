Labels are not indented, and are snake case followed by a colon:
this will insert a label in the assembler saying hey, if you see `snake_case`, 
i mean the address of the instruction directly following this label

snake_case:

Instructions must be indented, this can be spaces or tabs
example:
    LDA 0x40

two semicolons (;;) anywhere in a line denotes a comment, nothing after will be seen by the assembler
foo_bar:
    LDA 0x40 ;; Get the value from biz baz into the accumulator

That's really about it lol
